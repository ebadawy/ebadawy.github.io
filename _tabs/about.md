## Who am I?

Hello! My name is Ehab A. AlBadawy. I hold a PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University at Albany, SUNY and a B.Eng. in Computer Engineering from Ain Shams University in Egypt.

## What I Do

I'm currently an Applied Research Scientist at Meta, where I work on Text-to-Speech (TTS) technologies, particularly focusing on deep learning models to improve TTS quality and performance.

### Academic Research

During my PhD at the University at Albany, SUNY, I was fortunate to work with a number of distinguished professors. My initial research was under the supervision of Prof. Yelin Kim and focused on affective computing and automatic emotion recognition using deep learning approaches. Prof. Kim later moved to Amazon, which led me to continue my PhD under the advisement of Prof. Ming-Ching Chang. I was also co-advised by Prof. Siwei Lyu from the University at Buffalo, SUNY. During this period, I had the chance to collaborate with Prof. Hany Farid from UC Berkeley on media forensics-related projects.

I also had the privilege of being a Visiting Research Scholar at Duke University's RAILabs, where I worked with Dr. Maciej A. Mazurowski. My research there focused on leveraging deep learning for medical applications, particularly in brain tumor and breast cancer segmentation.

## What's This Blog About?

This blog is my little corner on the internet where I explore various topics in Machine Learning. Expect to see:

- **Small Projects**: From building your first neural network to more advanced projects.
- **Deep Dives**: In-depth analysis on certain Machine Learning topics.
- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides to help you grasp complex algorithms.
- **Case Studies**: Practical applications of Machine Learning in different industries.
